% INPUT:
%     - MIFeatures - Matrix of the features per trial (trials in rows 
%                    features in columns)
%     - targetLabels - Vector of labels per trial.
%     - trials2remove - Vector of trials to remove (Noise\ Artifacts).
%     - recordingFolder - Folder to save in the new model.
%
% OUTPUT:
%     - model - ML Object.
%     - validationAccuracy - Cross validation mean accuracy of the model.

%% Offline Training Model Main Script
function MI_Offline_Training()
% MI_OFFLINE_TRAINING performs a simulation and data recording. Cleans the data,
% preprocesses it. Feature extracted, including attached parameters. A model is being
% trained over extracted features, and mean validation accuracy is printed.
%
% All data is being saved along the script in designated folder created by
% the script. Folder's final name consists of date (including hours and
% minutes), and mean validation accuracy.

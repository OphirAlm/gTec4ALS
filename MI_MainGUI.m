%% MI_MAINGUI
% Software for MI-based BCI communication system for disabled patients.
% Communication utilizes spelling keyboard and text to speach function.
%
% Software runs three types of systems:
%     - Offline - Runs an offline simulation. Creates a ML classification
%          model based on recorded data.
%
%     - Online - Runs an online simulation, including feedback. Creates a 
%          ML classification model based on recorded data. 
%          - Has an option of accumulating data between sessions such that
%            the new model will be trained with recorded and previous data.
%
%     - Communication - Currently operateable for 4 classifications only. 
%          Operate movements on keyboard using Right or Left MI.
%          Choose button with Leg MI.
%          No-Decision option for precision purposes.
%          Send button for Text-To-Speach.
%          Lock option to prevent gibberish when speech is unwanted.
